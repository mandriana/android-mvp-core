## 1.1.0
Created a presenter provider and presenter factory to allow constructor injected presenter when using base views with dagger.

## 1.0.11
Fixed the cache synchronization subject by using a replay subject instead.
The getValue() of the BehaviorSubject was returning null in some cases 

## 1.0.10
onTerminate couldn't be used because notifications were observed. Instead action is performed after view received callbacks.
Added annotations on action callbacks signature for the non null view.

## 1.0.9
Fixed the call of onTerminate action which was done after the original observable completion instead of the replay completion.
This caused the isCompleted notification never be retrieved if received while view was not available.

## 1.0.8
Fixed presenter destruction.
"cancelAll" is now final and protected to be called in presenter.

## 1.0.7 
Fixed pom publication in aar.
Added missing annotation Nullable, NonNull ... (for better kotlin support).

## 1.0.6 
Upgraded dependencies.
Added use of ConcurrentHashmap for observable cache in RxPresenter.

## 1.0.5 (Core only)
Upgraded dependencies versions.
Fixed tag in AbstractSubscriptionProxy.

## 1.0.4
Upgraded dependencies versions.
Fixed a bug when retrieving a presenter from the cache when multiple views with presenters were created in a very short time.
Added logs and ability to activate/deactivate them.

## 1.0.2
startOnViewAttached now accepts an Action1 to provide the view as action parameter.
Upgraded dependencies versions.

## 1.0.1
Fixed the startOnViewAttached method so that the action is started instead of added to the queue if the view is already attached.

## 1.0.0
Project available
